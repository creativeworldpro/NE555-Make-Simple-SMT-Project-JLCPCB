The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. They supply high quality PCBs at a very reasonable price. They also can provide SMT circuit assembly.

We thanks to our sponsor JLCPCB https://jlcpcb.com/RTA for sponsoring us PCBs for this project circuit.


In this project circuit, we will teach you making a best quality SMT led blinker circuit. It is a very cheap and nice looking SMT project circuit.


To make this circuit, we use only DC-3.7v. You also can use 18650 battery pack to make this circuit. Without this battery, you also can make this circuit, but make sure that the power supply don’t produce high ampere.


To making this SMT led project circuit, we are using some SMD components. You can order your assembled SMT circuit form JLCPCB. To order SMT PCBs Click here.
